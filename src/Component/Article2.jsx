              It has been two years since the Covid-19 pandemic has occurred
              throughout the world, including Indonesia. This has had a major
              impact on various sectors. The economic sector is the sector most
              affected by this, especially MSMEs. MSME actors are a group of
              people who have felt the impact of the pandemic significantly,
              especially in the early days of the pandemic in Indonesia. Many of
              the MSME groups are not ready to face this event, considering that
              MSME actors are still running their business conventionally. The
              impact felt by MSME actors is the decline in people's purchasing
              power for MSME businesses.

              Recent developments in Information Technology (IT) have brought
              about a lot of changes in people's lifestyles, and being faced
              with a pandemic situation requires all people of all ages to be
              able to use IT-based technology devices for the sake of survival.
              One of the uses of IT is through the use of e-commerce in the
              business and social fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              E-commerce is the marketing, selling, and purchasing of a product,
              both services and goods that utilize telecommunications networks
              such as the internet and computer networks(Amrullah, 2020). The
              use of e-commerce is also beneficial for MSMEs, especially those
              who are just starting a business, in terms of operational costs.
              E-commerce helps reduce operational costs, including store
              rentals, product storefronts, marketing and logistics strategies,
              and supply chains.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the E-Commerce that has helped MSMEs is the TaniHub
              application. TaniHub is an application and website-based
              e-commerce that is here to provide convenience for everyone, both
              households and businesses, to meet all the needs of vegetables,
              fruit, fish, to basic necessities directly from Indonesian
              farmers. With this application, business actors will be greatly
              helped in terms of sales and marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are several applications that resemble the TaniHub
              application. These applications have the same goal, namely to
              assist MSME actors in marketing their products and make it easy
              for consumers to get products directly from the hands of the
              seller and have high quality. Applications such as TaniHub help
              SMEs in the agribusiness sector. There are still no applications
              that help SMEs in the culinary business sector specifically.
              Culinary businesses are SMEs that are engaged in the culinary
              field such as selling food and raw materials for making food.
              Culinary business SMEs usually market their products on delivery
              service applications. But the MSME culinary business will lose
              competitiveness with restaurants that have well-known brand names.
              Therefore, there is a need for an E-Commerce application that
              helps MSMEs in the culinary business so that MSMEs in the culinary
              business are better known by the wider community.
